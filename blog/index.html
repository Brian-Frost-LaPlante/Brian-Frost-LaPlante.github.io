In light of this major accomplishment, I decided it was time to slow down the pace of my life. Going to the park is a calming and slow task, exactly what I need, but I am genuinely incapable of doing anything the slow, simple or easy way. So I am visiting every park in New York City, and placing markers on a map I made in MapBox. I&#39;ll also be editing Wikipedia, whose list of NYC parks is incomplete.</div></div> <p>...</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="/blog/Optimal_rotation/">Quaternions and Volume Registration – A Comprehensive Approach</a></strong></p> </ul> <div class=row ><div class=container > <img class=left  style="width:30%;" src="/assets/Cayley Q8 quaternion multiplication graph.svg"> Suppose you have two point-sets in 3-D space, related by a rotation and translation – in the presence of some noise, how can you determine this relationship given only the point-sets? This problem is one of <em>registration</em>, i.e. determining which points in each point-set correspond to one another. <em>Quaternions</em> are very useful for representing 3-D rotation, but their use in solving this registration problem is poorly, and sometimes <strong>erroneously</strong> documented. In this post, I wish to provide a more comprehensive view of how quaternions function, and their role in volume registration, as well as correct one publication&#39;s major errors.

Features include: standard flashcard-style vocab study, japanese text-to-speech for pronunciation, webscraping for &quot;words of the day&quot; and a companion Discord bot&#33; While the program is geared towards my study of Japanese language, it can easily be modified to suit any language with a few tweaks.

In this first post, I will be covering the theory behind OCT imaging and vibrometry, and discussing why this modality is so well-suited for the study of cochlear micromechanics.
