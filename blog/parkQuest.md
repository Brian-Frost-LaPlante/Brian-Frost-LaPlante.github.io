In August of 2023, I finished the first draft of my doctoral thesis. In light of this major accomplishment, I decided it was time to slow down the pace of my life. Going to the park is a calming and slow task, exactly what I need, but I am genuinely incapable of doing anything the slow, simple or easy way. So I am visiting every park in New York City, and placing markers on a map I made in MapBox. I'll also be editing Wikipedia, whose list of NYC parks is incomplete.
